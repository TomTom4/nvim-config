# My Personal Nvim Configurations

heavily inspired on [josean-dev configurations](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files/tree/main/.config/nvim).

Btw there is also an [awesome youtube tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM&t=1011s)

##Â prerequisites:

you need to install lazygit, lipgrep and a nerd font for this setup to work.

## install

```bash

git clone git@github.com:TomTom4/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim

```

then simply fire up nvim, and install all the packages through the lazy ui:

```bash
nvim
# with in nvim :Lazy, then hit I for installing all the plugins
# then close nvim
```

## use

```bash
nvim
```
